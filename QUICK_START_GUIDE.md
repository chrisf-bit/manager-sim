# Under Pressure: Quick Start Guide

## What Is This?

You're a middle manager leading a team of five through a challenging quarter. Every decision you make has consequences—some immediate, some delayed, some visible, some hidden.

## The Screen

### Left Panel: Your Dashboard

**Metrics** — Six measures of how things are going:
- Trust, Engagement, Performance, Fairness, Credibility, and Retention
- Green is good. Yellow is warning. Red is trouble.

**Your Load** — Your personal stress level. Push too hard and it catches up with you.

**Team Capacity** — Shows how many team members remain active:
- Displays active members out of 5 total
- Shows average workload percentage
- Green when healthy, yellow when understaffed
- Watch for overload warnings

**Budget** — Financial resources for team investments:
- Start with £5,000 each year
- Earn more budget quarterly based on your team's performance
- Budget investments cost money; time investments are always free
- When funds run low, you'll need to prioritize carefully

**Investments** — How you choose to spend your time and budget:
- *Budget*: Training (£200/10%), Team Activities (£150/10%), Tools (£250/10%), Recognition (£100/10%)
- *Time*: 1:1s, Coaching, Strategy, Your Wellbeing (always free)

Budget investments require funds. Time investments are always available. Adjust investments each quarter based on your available budget.

### Middle Panel: What's Happening

**Events** — Situations land on your desk. Read carefully. Choose wisely.

**Observations** — Ambient signals from your team. Not instructions—just things you notice.

### Right Panel: Your Team

Five individuals, each with their own personality, history, and current state. Their trust and engagement shift based on your decisions.

When team members are overloaded, you'll see workload indicators:
- 🔥 **BURNOUT RISK** — Over 140% capacity
- ⚠️ **OVERLOADED** — Over 120% capacity
- ⚡ **STRETCHED** — Over 100% capacity

Departed members appear grayed out with a **DEPARTED** badge.

## How to Make Decisions

1. **Read** the situation carefully
2. **Discuss** the options with your team (in workshops)
3. **Click** an option to select it (highlighted in purple)
4. **Change your mind** if needed — click a different option
5. **Click "Confirm Decision"** when ready to commit

Once confirmed, you move to the next situation. There's no going back.

## The Budget System

Between quarters, you'll attend a budget review meeting where you receive funding based on your team's performance:

**How Allocation Works:**
- Your composite score (average of Trust, Engagement, Performance, Fairness, Credibility) determines your share
- You compete with other teams for a £20,000 quarterly pot
- Strong performance (70+) yields £6,000+
- Average performance (60-70) yields £4,500-£6,000
- Weak performance (<60) yields under £4,500

**Managing Your Budget:**
- Unspent budget carries forward to the next quarter
- Plan ahead: some investments cost more than others
- If funds run out, you'll rely solely on time investments
- Budget constraints force tough prioritization decisions

## Attrition & Burnout

Your team has limits. Push too hard, and people will leave. When they do, the remaining team absorbs their workload—and the cycle accelerates.

**How Capacity Works:**
- Each team member has 20 capacity units
- Full team capacity: 100 units (5 people × 20)
- Work demand stays constant at 100 units
- When someone leaves, their work redistributes equally among remaining members

**Burnout Penalties:**
- Workload over 100% causes burnout
- For every 10% overload: -5 engagement, -3 trust
- Example: If 4 people remain, each carries 125% load = -10 engagement, -6 trust per quarter
- Characters at 140%+ load become at-risk and may leave

**What Triggers Departures:**
- High performers (80+) who feel undervalued (low trust/fairness)
- Low engagement (<35) or trust (<40)
- Unsustainable workload (120%+ load)
- Maximum one departure per quarter

**Warning Signs:**
- 🔥 **BURNOUT RISK** badge appears at 140%+ workload
- ⚠️ **OVERLOADED** badge appears at 120%+ workload
- **RISK** badge shows characters at risk of leaving
- Notifications like "Someone updated their LinkedIn profile"
- Team capacity widget shows reduced headcount

**When Someone Leaves:**
- You'll see a departure screen with their reason
- Team morale drops (-5 trust, -8 engagement across remaining members)
- Workload per person increases immediately
- Their desk stays empty for the rest of the game

The death spiral is real: Poor decisions → First departure → Higher workload → Burnout → More departures.

## The Trade-Offs

There are no perfect choices. Every option has consequences:

- **Fairness vs. Flexibility** — Treating everyone the same isn't always fair. Making exceptions isn't always unfair.

- **Performance vs. People** — Hitting targets matters. So does how you hit them.

- **Short-term vs. Long-term** — The quick fix today might cost you tomorrow.

- **Your needs vs. Theirs** — You can't pour from an empty cup. But the team still needs you.

## Tips (Without Spoilers)

- Pay attention to who's involved in each situation
- Your investments aren't just numbers—they shape outcomes
- There's no undo button
- What you don't do matters as much as what you do

## How It Ends

After four quarters, you'll see your leadership profile based on the patterns in your decisions. There's no winning or losing—just consequences and reflection.

Good luck. Your team is counting on you.
