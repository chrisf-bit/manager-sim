# Under Pressure: Quick Start Guide

## What Is This?

You're a middle manager leading a team of five through a challenging quarter. Every decision you make has consequences—some immediate, some delayed, some visible, some hidden.

## The Screen

### Left Panel: Your Dashboard

**Metrics** — Six measures of how things are going:
- Trust, Engagement, Performance, Fairness, Credibility, and Retention
- Green is good. Yellow is warning. Red is trouble.

**Your Load** — Your personal stress level. Push too hard and it catches up with you.

**Investments** — How you choose to spend your time and budget this quarter:
- *Budget*: Training, Team Activities, Tools, Recognition
- *Time*: 1:1s, Coaching, Strategy, Your Wellbeing

These default to zero. Adjust them however you see fit. There's no "right" answer.

### Middle Panel: What's Happening

**Events** — Situations land on your desk. Read carefully. Choose wisely.

**Observations** — Ambient signals from your team. Not instructions—just things you notice.

### Right Panel: Your Team

Five individuals, each with their own personality, history, and current state. Their trust and engagement shift based on your decisions.

## How to Make Decisions

1. **Read** the situation carefully
2. **Discuss** the options with your team (in workshops)
3. **Click** an option to select it (highlighted in purple)
4. **Change your mind** if needed — click a different option
5. **Click "Confirm Decision"** when ready to commit

Once confirmed, you move to the next situation. There's no going back.

## The Trade-Offs

There are no perfect choices. Every option has consequences:

- **Fairness vs. Flexibility** — Treating everyone the same isn't always fair. Making exceptions isn't always unfair.

- **Performance vs. People** — Hitting targets matters. So does how you hit them.

- **Short-term vs. Long-term** — The quick fix today might cost you tomorrow.

- **Your needs vs. Theirs** — You can't pour from an empty cup. But the team still needs you.

## Tips (Without Spoilers)

- Pay attention to who's involved in each situation
- Your investments aren't just numbers—they shape outcomes
- There's no undo button
- What you don't do matters as much as what you do

## How It Ends

After four quarters, you'll see your leadership profile based on the patterns in your decisions. There's no winning or losing—just consequences and reflection.

Good luck. Your team is counting on you.
