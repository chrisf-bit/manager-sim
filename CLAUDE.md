# Under Pressure: The People Management Simulation

## Design Context

### Users
Middle managers and aspiring leaders in workshop or training environments. They're learning through practice, often in facilitated sessions with colleagues. The context is professional development—users are reflecting on their leadership style through simulated decisions with real consequences.

### Brand Personality
**Smart, Bold, Human**

- **Smart**: Sophisticated thinking, nuanced scenarios, respects user intelligence
- **Bold**: Confident visual presence, purple-forward palette, decisive design choices
- **Human**: Warm despite the dark theme, focuses on people not just metrics, emotionally authentic

### Aesthetic Direction
**Premium dark simulation with modern software polish**

- **Visual tone**: Dark, immersive, confident. Think premium SaaS meets strategic game
- **References**: Linear, Notion, Figma—clean interfaces that feel crafted, not templated
- **Anti-references**: NOT AI-generated aesthetics (generic gradients, predictable layouts, stock-feeling illustrations). NOT cheap gamification (badges, confetti, cartoon elements). NOT corporate LMS (sterile, boring, dated)
- **Theme**: Dark mode exclusively. Rich blacks (#000, #0f0f1a) with vibrant accent pops

### Typography
**Poppins** — Clean, modern, highly legible. Use weight hierarchy (300-700) for visual rhythm.

### Design Principles

1. **Decisions feel weighty**: Design should reinforce that choices matter. No frivolous animations, no flippant copy. Every interaction carries consequence.

2. **Confidence, not complexity**: Users should feel capable and in control. Clear visual hierarchy, predictable patterns, immediate feedback. Complex scenarios, simple interface.

3. **Human over data**: Metrics matter but people matter more. Team members should feel like people, not numbers. Emotional authenticity over gamification.

4. **Crafted, not generated**: Every detail should look intentional. Avoid generic patterns, templated layouts, or anything that feels AI-generated. Custom touches over defaults.

5. **Premium restraint**: Bold doesn't mean busy. Use the vibrant palette strategically. White space is confidence. Let the content breathe.
